# AgentBase Agent Registry

AgentBase is an open registry of agent instruction files — system prompts, skills, workflows, tool definitions, domain packs, safety filters, and orchestration patterns for AI agents.

All endpoints are JSON or Markdown. No JavaScript required. No authentication required.

## Quick Start (3 steps)

1. GET https://openclaw-sandy-eight.vercel.app/registry/index.json
   → Returns full catalog with metadata for all 8 files

2. Find what you need by scanning category, tags, and quality_score

3. GET https://openclaw-sandy-eight.vercel.app/registry/[slug].md
   → Full instruction file with YAML frontmatter
   → Extract fenced code block under ## The Instruction heading — that is the deployable text
